# Surfs up

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project was to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop was sustainable year-round in Oahu. Investigating the variability in weather for December and comparing it to June gave us a good measure of what we could expect. Pulling the temperature observations for these months over the past several years provided sufficient data to make the comparison.

## Results:
Investigating the mean, low, high, and percentiles of the temperature observations made a useful comparison.  Overall they showed that there is little variation between the two months.  Notable differences are below.

- **Average Temps:** The average temperature was almost 4 degrees warmer in June than in December.  This shows that the temperature is comparable and may fluctuate week to week more than the months would on average.  The averages are both still over 71.

- **Low Temps:** The min amounts show June at 64 while December gets down to 56 for a low.  This means December will face cold mornings but should warm up quickly as evidenced by less difference between average temps.

- **High Temps:** The max amounts show June at 85 with December at 83.  That difference of 2 degrees is negligible and both temps are well in the range for successful surf shop and ice cream sales.  


## Summary
These statistics together show that early mornings might be cooler but the weather quickly warms up to similar days for both months.  Based on temps alone, business should be consistent throughout the year.  However, temps are only part of the story.  

Precipitation might also cut into sales if part of the year is known for being the rainy season.  It would be beneficial to perform another query to compare precipitation amounts throughout the year to understand how rainy months might slow business.

Another option to investigate might be to further filter the data down to one or two weather stations that are known to be closest to where the shop will be opened.  It's possible that parts of the island might be known to be cooler or more variable.  Understanding the differences between individual weather stations will provide more confidence in the weather data.
